# Cluster Setup and Hardening

## CIS Benchmarks
CIS Kubernetes Benchmark is a set of security configuration best practices to harden Kubernetes components like etcd, kubelet, kube-apiserver, etc. You must assess and fix insecure settings to meet the benchmark.

### Tools
#### `kube-bench` tool (by Aqua Security).
kube-bench audit against the CIS Benchmark. It scans your cluster for known insecure default configurations and suggests remediations.

Run as Job
```bash
 kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench/main/job.yaml

 # Check logs
 kubectl logs -l job-name=kube-bench

 # More details from logs
k logs kube-bench-qdcgk | less
k logs kube-bench-qdcgk | grep FAIL

```

 Run from binary file https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench/releases
```bash
# Install
wget https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench/releases/download/v0.10.4/kube-bench_0.10.4_darwin_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf kube-bench_0.10.4_darwin_amd64.tar.gz

# run a test
./kube-bench --config-dir `pwd`/cfg --config `pwd`/cfg/config.yaml
./kube-bench -D cfg
```

 #### CIS-CAT Pro Assessor tool called Assessor-CLI
 The CIS-CAT Pro Assessor CLI is a command-line tool from the Center for Internet Security (CIS) that automates the evaluation of system configurations against CIS Benchmarks, including Kubernetes. Itâ€™s used to validate compliance and hardening based on best practices.

``` bash
 sh ./Assessor-CLI.sh -i -rd /var/www/html/ -nts -rp index
